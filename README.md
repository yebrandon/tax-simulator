## About

Tax Simulator is an educational 2D role playing game geared towards teaching youth about tax deductions and savings vehicles. Play as... yourself... and explore the not-so-vast world of a small town where the only things you can physically do are work, party, buy real estate, and consult your tax advisor, as you manage your finances from age 18-65!

This project was developed by Ryan Aird, Colin Fang, Alicia Tran, and Brandon Ye at Hack Western VI, a 36 hour hackathon at Western University, and was awarded Best Education Hack to Introduce Students to Taxes and Benefits. It was built in Unity with C#, featuring tilemap level designs, a dialogue system, and a custom "wallet" API for handling tax calculations.
